I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineer, a Software Engineer, a Pentester, a Marine, and a few other things. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sdheath) for more professional details. This website is a platform for me to share useful solutions and tools that I find or create in any of the random things I'm working on. Please reach out through any of the contact channels I have listed - I'd love to hear any advice, criticism, or praise you have.
